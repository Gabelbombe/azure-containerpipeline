# Automated Azure Container Pipeline

## Background

Creating a automated build pipeline for Azure has been an idea I've been kicking around for awhile. This should be a detailed walkthrough on how to do this _without_ automation while gearing up for a full [Terraform](https://terraform.io) pipeline later... Because we all know I'm obsessed with automating __all the things__.
